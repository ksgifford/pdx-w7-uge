1. Rate today's workshop on a scale of 1-10:
8 - Teaching was excellent, but while the subject matter is very important, it isn't the most exciting part of development.


2. Things from today that I liked:
Beth was very knowledgeable, personable and willing to respond to the needs of the class. She slowed down on topics where we had a lot of questions and moved quickly through items that we picked up easily. She also did an excellent job of translating complex ideas into plain English.
I also appreciatd the step-by-step nature of the instruction, paired with a good explanation of WHY we were doing it that way.


3. Things from today that I would improve:
It's a bit nitpicky, but less text on each presentation slide would have been nice, along with an easy way (color coding?) to parse which items were commands we were supposed to enter and which items were the text we were supposed to see returned on the terminal. When there is a lot on each slide, this stuff can get lost.

### Testing Out of the Workshop

To test out of the workshop, you will need to complete this assignment. Completion of this assignment, whether independently or at the workshop, is due before the start of your Code Fellows course.

Demonstrate the following skills using **only** your Terminal, your text editor, and your web browser.

##### 1. Create a fork of this repository

##### 2. Clone the fork to your computer

##### 3. Create a new branch called `notes`

##### 4. Checkout the branch `notes`

##### 5. Create a directory with the same name as your GitHub username

For example, `codefellows`

##### 6. Create a `unix_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/unix_notes.txt`

##### 7. Add the notes about what you've learned about Unix to this file

For example,

```
cd <path> Changes the working directory to <path>
ls <path> Lists the directory content of <path>
...
```

##### 8. Create a `git_notes.txt` file in this directory

For example, `codefellows/git_notes.txt`

##### 9. Add the notes about what you've learned about Git to this file

For example,

```
git add <file> Adds any changes inside <file> to the staging area
git commit -m '<message>' Commits the staging area to the repository with a <message>
...
```

##### 10. Add these untracked files to the staging area

##### 11. Commit the changes

##### 12. Push the branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub

##### 13. Send a pull request from this branch to Code Fellows' `master` branch
